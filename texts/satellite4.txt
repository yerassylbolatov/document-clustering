A satellite is any object that orbits (goes around) a planet or a star. Our moon is a natural satellite because it orbits the earth. The earth itself is a natural satellite of the sun, because it revolves around the sun. All of the planets in our solar system are satellites of the sun. Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all have multiple moons that orbit them. Their moons are satellites of those planets. Our solar system has over 200 known natural satellites. There are also artificial, man-made satellites that are in orbit around the earth. These are the fast-moving objects you can often see in the night sky. They are deliberately launched into orbit around a body in space, usually with a specific job to do that involves receiving and sending back information to Earth. Why are they out there? How do they work? Let's find out more about satellites.
