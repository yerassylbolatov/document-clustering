The domestic cat, or house cat, is a small mammal that has lived among people for thousands of years. People have kept cats as pets, used them as hunters, and even worshipped them as gods. Domestic cats belong to the same animal family as the lion, tiger, jaguar, leopard, puma, and cheetah. The scientific name of the domestic cat is Felis catus. Domestic cats live with people in nearly every part of the world. Some domestic cats have no home. These cats, called feral cats, wander freely in many cities. The domestic cat has a long and powerfully built body. Males are about 28 inches (71 centimeters) long. Females are about 20 inches (51 centimeters) long. Large eyes help the cat to see well at night. Its triangular ears can turn quickly toward the source of a sound. Four rows of stiff whiskers grow on each side of the nose. These give the cat a delicate sense of touch. A cats fur may be black, white, brown, gray, yellow, red, or orange. It may also be striped (tabby); a mixture of white, black, and yellow (tortoiseshell); or marked with patches of color (calico). Cats use their rough tongues to comb and to clean their fur. There are many breeds of domestic cat. Cats of the same breed have a similar length of hair and other similar features. Most breeds for example, the Abyssinian, the American Shorthair, and the Siamese have short hair. Other breeds, including the Persian, have long, thick coats.
