London is the capital city of the United Kingdom. It is the U.K.’s largest metropolis and its economic, transportation, and cultural centre. London is also among the oldest of the world’s great cities, with its history spanning nearly two millennia. London’s founding can be traced to 43 CE, when the Roman armies began their occupation of Britain under Emperor Claudius. At a point just north of the marshy valley of the River Thames, where two low hills were sited, they established a settlement they called Londinium. The first definite mention of London occurs in 60 CE by the Roman historian Tacitus. During World War II London suffered intense aerial bombardment by Nazi forces during the Blitz, a campaign from September 1940 to May 1941 that devastated the city. An estimated 43,000 Londoners died, and a further 50,000 were injured. More than 70,000 buildings were destroyed, and many more were damaged. The Blitz failed to break Britain, however, and Nazi Germany abandoned the attacks. London is one of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities. It is the largest metropolis in the United Kingdom, and it is also the country’s economic, transportation, and cultural centre. In addition to its history, art, and politics, London is a popular tourist destination for its wide variety of museums, shops, restaurants, and sports teams. London is situated in southeastern England, lying on both sides of the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. London, city, capital of the United Kingdom.
